# 🧠 Motiv8 – iOS Exposure Therapy App #
### Swift | SwiftUI | Xcode ###
Motiv8 is an iOS app I’m building in Swift/Xcode designed around exposure therapy principles. The goal is to create a visual, habit-based system where users face small ego-challenging tasks and watch their “ego” visually weaken over time, turning personal growth into a game.

## Why I'm Building It ##
This app is personal. It’s based on the idea that we grow by doing the uncomfortable things — and I wanted a way to track that, not just through checkboxes, but in a way that feels rewarding and slightly weird (in a good way).

## Features ## 
- Visual feedback loop showing ego weakening as habits are completed
- Simple checklist interface for building exposure challenges
- Plans for future habit analytics and authentication (via iCloud or external backend)

## 📚 What I Learned ##
- Basic UI concepts (VStack, HStack, ZStack) and layout management in Swift
- Local state management and persistent user sessions
- UX principles for User navigation

## 🚧 Roadmap ##
- [x] Add task page
- [ ] Add ego HP and visual deterioration of ego
- [ ] Add default tasks
- [ ] Add navigation bar
- [ ] Add previous tasks page
- [ ] Add profile page with XP and metrics
- [ ] Add journaling and reflection page
- [ ] Add habit adaptation (increase/decrease difficulty based on user feedback)
- [ ] Backend integration for persistent user data
- [ ] Deploy on App Store
