# 🧠 Motiv8 – iOS Exposure Therapy App #
### Swift | SwiftUI | Xcode ###
Motiv8 is an iOS app designed to guide users through exposure-based habit-building visually. 
The app reframes ego resistance as a “weakenable” force, helping users override avoidance behaviours with daily action.

## Features ## 
- Visual feedback loop showing ego weakening as habits are completed
- Simple checklist interface for building exposure challenges
- Plans for future habit analytics and authentication (via iCloud or external backend)

## 📚 What I Learned ##

- Local state management and persistent user sessions
- UX principles for User navigation
